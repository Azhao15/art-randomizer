**Netlify Deployment URL**: https://celebrated-sundae-4c705d.netlify.app/  

**Notes**: I created a random art piece generator for the Art Institute of Chicago (leveraging their api). Within this webapp, there is a generate artwork button that will go through and display a new piece of art each time it is clicked from the AIC and displays some of the general information about the piece. It also has a feature to select favorite pieces of art and keep them saved.  
The implementation of the project using lovable was actually quite smooth, the main issue I'd say I ran into was credit limits. I think I prompted lovable well enough to have it carry out a feature implementation in a more concise way which lead to less hallucination/errors. I do think that the main trouble I ran into were credit limits, which I had actually first intended to carry out the game implementation option for this assignment on Bolt, but wasn't getting the results that I wanted.  
Overall, I spent about 1.5 hours total on this assignment.
